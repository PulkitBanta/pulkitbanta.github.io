  faqs: [
    {
      q: 'What is Connectio?',
      a: 'Connectio is a desktop app that runs a local reverse proxy. You add your local development servers and write path rules, for example /api/* → localhost:3001. Then you can access all of the servers through one address, for example localhost:8080.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is Connectio free?',
      a: 'Yes. Connectio is free and open source. It uses the MIT license. The source code is on GitHub.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Which operating systems can it run on?',
      a: 'Connectio runs on macOS with Apple Silicon, on 64-bit Windows, and on Linux (AppImage or .deb). For Intel Macs and other architectures, build Connectio from the source code.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does Connectio prevent CORS errors in local development?',
      a: 'CORS errors occur when your frontend and your API use different ports. The browser thinks that different ports are different origins. Connectio puts both behind the same port. Thus, the requests have the same origin, and the browser does not block them.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How is it different from nginx or Caddy?',
      a: 'nginx and Caddy are production web servers. You configure them with text files, and you must reload them after each change. Connectio is for local development. You edit rules in a UI, and the rules apply when you start the server. Connectio shows each request in a live log. It saves each configuration as JSON that you can load again.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Do I need Docker?',
      a: 'No. Connectio sends requests to servers that already run on your computer. You can start these servers in any way: npm scripts, Go binaries, Docker containers with published ports, or other programs that listen on localhost.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How do Cloudflare tunnels work in Connectio?',
      a: 'Before you start the server, enable "Cloudflare tunnel". Connectio starts a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel and shows the public trycloudflare.com URL. When you stop the server, Connectio closes the tunnel. You must have cloudflared in a directory on your PATH. All persons who have the URL can access every route. Thus, use tunnels only for development.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Where are my configs stored?',
      a: 'Connectio keeps configs as JSON files in the user data folder of your operating system: ~/Library/Application Support/connectio/configs on macOS, %APPDATA%/connectio/configs on Windows, and ~/.config/connectio/configs on Linux.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why does my operating system show a warning when I open Connectio for the first time?',
      a: 'Connectio does not have a code signature yet. Thus, macOS and Windows ask you to confirm the first launch. The install guide gives the procedure. Alternatively, use the install script, which prevents these prompts.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How do I update Connectio?',
      a: 'Download the new release and install it over the old version. Alternatively, run the install script again. Connectio keeps your saved configs.',
    },
  ],
